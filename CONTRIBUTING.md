# How to contribute

If you'd like to contribute to this project that is absolutely fantastic.
We are still very much in the early stages of this so any contributions, 
big or small, are welcome.

## Testing

There are a number of tests written for the rails portion of the application.
Please add these if you contribute any changes.

The whole suite can be run using

```sh
rails test
```

## Submitting changes

As usual, please raise a PR in this repository.
Writing out a clear description of what you've done and, crucially, the reasons for doing it will ensure that your change gets the consideration that it deserves.

Commits should make sense on their own. The size of the commit is not of concern, just that it should make sense and pass all tests were it checked in alone.

Making use of formatting tools is not yet automated. Please consider running Prettier on your js code and rubocop on your ruby code.


Thanks,

Matt
